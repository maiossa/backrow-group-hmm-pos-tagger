# Parts of Speech tagging using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)

--------
This repository is the result of a project we did as part of our computational syntax course, which is part of the syllabus of the Master in Language Analysis and Processing on EHU/UPV.
--------

## Objectives

- Implement a Hidden Model for PoS tagging from scratch
- Experiment on different languages  from the universal dependencies databank

## What is POS tagging with HMMs?

=======

These datasets were selected because they differ in linguistic complexity (English vs. German), which is useful for evaluating the HMM POS tagger across languages.
