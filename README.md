# Backrow Group HMM POS Tagger

Implementation of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for Part-of-Speech tagging.  
Experiments are performed on two Universal Dependencies datasets (English EWT and German GSD) to compare performance across languages.

## Datasets

This project uses two treebanks from the Universal Dependencies (UD) collection:

- **English – EWT (English Web Treebank)**  
  `UD_English-EWT`

- **German – GSD (German Google Treebank)**  
  `UD_German-GSD`

These datasets were selected because they differ in linguistic complexity (English vs. German), which is useful for evaluating the HMM POS tagger across languages.
