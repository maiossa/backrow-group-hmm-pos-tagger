# Parts of Speech tagging using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)

--------

This repository is the result of a project we did as part of our computational syntax course, which is part of the syllabus of the Master in Language Analysis and Processing on EHU/UPV.

## Objectives

- Implement a Hidden Model for PoS tagging from scratch
- Experiment on different languages  from the universal dependencies databank

## What is POS tagging with HMMs?
